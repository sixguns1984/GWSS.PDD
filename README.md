MEGA.PHS.R was used to calculate polygenic hazard score for subjects, input files include genotyping file and file with Hazard ratio of SNP. 
The cohort clinical and genotyping and sample list data was available after approved by Brigham & Women's Hospital, please send request email to Liu Ganqiang, Ph.D. <liugq3@mail.sysu.edu.cn>  and Scherzer, Clemens R.,M.D. <cscherzer@rics.bwh.harvard.edu>
